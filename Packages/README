To install:
1. Choose which firefox theme you want to use:
-IE3 Classic: No tabs just the good old classic IE look
-IE6 Classic: An upgraded IE6 theme with tab support and IE6 icons (toolbar has icons with text underneath)
-IE6 Icons only: A compact version of the IE6 theme with icons only on the toolbar. Also removes toolbar background image pattern.

2. Extract the desired theme archive into your firefox user profile directory:
-Locate your profile directory (eg. ~/.mozilla/firefox/user.default)
-Make a directory inside called "chrome"
-Extract the theme archive into the chrome directory:
-Example: tar -xvzf ie3_classic_firefox.tar.gz -C ~/.mozilla/firefox/user.default/chrome/

3. Close all Firefox instances and restart Firefox. The theme should now be activated.
